A nationwide public holiday (one with no state) is generated once per company
of the matching country, as a global time off without working hours, which
standard Odoo applies to every working schedule of that company.

A regional one is generated for single resources instead, so that people
sharing a schedule can have different regions. Resolving a region to the
resources concerned needs to know about people, which this module does not:
`hr_holidays_public_resource` resolves them from the work location of each
employee. On its own this module only applies nationwide public holidays.

Two aspects are configurable per working schedule, under *Configuration >
Working Schedules*:

- **Apply Employee Public Holidays** -- untick to leave the employees of a
  schedule without the personal entries of regional public holidays. The
  company-wide entries reach the schedule either way.

A public holiday line can also name **additional working schedules**: it is
then generated as a time off entry carrying each listed schedule, so
everybody working by it gets the day -- a special day for one shift plan,
say. Such an entry is only created where no company-wide record already
applies: a nationwide public holiday on the same day covers every schedule
anyway. A line naming only working schedules (no state) reaches exactly
those schedules.

The working schedule form shows a read-only overview of the public holidays
that reach it -- the nationwide ones of its companies, grouped by calendar
year with the newest days first. Only days the schedule actually works are
listed: a Friday holiday says nothing to a Monday-to-Thursday schedule. A
flexible schedule has no fixed days, so it lists every day. With
`hr_holidays_public_resource` installed, the regional and location-scoped
days of the employees on the schedule are counted as well.

A public holiday line can be **disabled** instead of deleted: it then
generates no time off at all but keeps its configuration. This is the escape
hatch for a special public holiday whose scope has gone away -- a line
assigned only to work locations that no longer exist would otherwise fall
back to applying to everybody.

**Set the country on your companies.** A public holiday calendar with a country
only reaches schedules whose company is in that country. A company with no
country at all is not filtered out -- otherwise nothing would be generated at
all -- so in a multi-country database an unset country makes every public
holiday apply everywhere. The public holiday form reports any public holiday
that generates no time off, and why.

By default only public holidays from 1 January of the current year onwards are
materialised. Set the `calendar_public_holiday_resource.sync_year_from` system
parameter to a year to change that floor.

Time off already generated for years before the floor is history and is left
untouched: raising the floor stops the maintenance of earlier records but does
not delete them, since removing them would re-evaluate historical leaves and
delete timesheets in closed periods. Deleting a public holiday line removes
its generated time off regardless, as an explicit act.
